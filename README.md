2. a) If you are installing it a local machine you can watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3uRXvwXz1o) on how to install it on local machine.<br/>
   b) If you are installing it on a hosting first make sure your hosting is supporting laravel and after that you should check your hosting admin panel if they have a `software installer` or a `third party software button` for example _[softaculous](https://www.softaculous.com/)_ if they don't have one or you don't know how to use it try asking your hosting company for support.
